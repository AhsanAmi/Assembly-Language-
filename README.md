# Assembly Language Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of assembly language programs designed to help you practice and improve your skills in x86 assembly programming. Each program is a standalone file that addresses a specific problem or task.

## Program List

1. **Swap Variables**
   - Description: Write an assembly program to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.

2. **Sum of Even Numbers**
   - Description: Create an assembly program to find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

3. **Hello, World!**
   - Description: Implement a program to print "Hello, World!" to the console in assembly language.

4. **Square of a Number**
   - Description: Write an assembly program to find the square of a given number.

5. **Vowel or Consonant**
   - Description: Develop a program to check if a given character is a vowel or a consonant in assembly.

6. **Linear Search**
   - Description: Write an assembly program to perform a linear search in an array for a specific value and return its index.

7. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - Description: Create an assembly program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

8. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**
   - Description: Implement an assembly program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

9. **Word Counter**
   - Description: Develop an assembly program to count the number of words in a string.

10. **Bubble Sort**
    - Description: Write an assembly program to sort an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.

11. **Decimal to Binary Converter**
    - Description: Create an assembly program to convert a decimal number to its binary representation.

12. **Basic Calculator**
    - Description: Write an assembly program to implement a basic calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

13. **File Line Counter**
    - Description: Implement an assembly program to read a file, count the number of lines, and display the contents.

14. **XOR Encryption/Decryption**
    - Description: Create an assembly program that encrypts and decrypts a text using the XOR operator.

## Usage
- Each program is contained in a separate file with a descriptive filename.
- You can assemble and run the programs using your preferred assembly language development environment or compiler.
